# AngularJS file upload

This app shows a working example of how to upload a file using AngularJS to a Go server. 

Clone the `angularjs-file-upload` locally, then open index.html in a browser

```
git clone https://github.com/natethinks/angularjs-file-upload.git
cd angularjs-file-upload
open app/index.html
```

To run the server, make sure golang is installed and run `go build && ./angularjs-file-upload` from the project directory
